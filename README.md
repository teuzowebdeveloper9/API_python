# Flask API Project

This repository contains a simple RESTful API built using the Flask framework in Python. This project was created for educational purposes, allowing me to practice and improve my API development skills as I prepare for job opportunities in this field.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a fictional book list. The API is designed to be easily understood and can serve as a foundation for more complex projects. The code is heavily commented to explain the functionality and thought process behind each step.

## Features

The API provides the following endpoints:

- **GET /books:** Retrieves a list of all books in JSON format.
- **GET /books/<id>:** Retrieves a specific book by its ID.
- **PUT /books/<id>:** Updates an existing book with new information.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language.
- **Flask:** A microframework for web development.
- **jsonify:** A Flask function to convert data to JSON format.
- **request:** A Flask object to access incoming request data.

Absolutely! Here's a README.md file in English for your GitHub repository, designed to showcase your Flask API project and highlight your learning journey:

## How to Use
You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or Insomnia.(I use a vs code plugin called FLASH I highly recommend it, being able to check your API in your IDE greatly increases your productivity and speed and it works well)

Example GET /books Request
GET http://localhost:5000/books
Example GET /books/1 Request
GET http://localhost:5000/books/1

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/<your-repository-name>.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd <your-repository-name>
Install 1  dependencies:   
1.
github.com
github.com

Bash

pip install Flask
Run the API:

Bash

python app.py
The API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

How to Use
You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or Insomnia.

Example GET /books Request
GET http://localhost:5000/books
Example GET /books/1 Request
GET http://localhost:5000/books/1
Example PUT /books/1 Request
PUT http://localhost:5000/books/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "New Book Title",
  "author": "New Book Author"
}
remembering this is just a test a real API should be MUCH MORE WORKED IN SECURITY THAN THAT
